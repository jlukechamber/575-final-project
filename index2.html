                    Each section of the first part of the flyover tour will talk about the concept that the continent
                    represents,
                    what each "country" or "subregion" on the continent represents.
                    As well as foundational texts and thinkers. The first continent "m-body"
                    is the mental conception of the body.

                    Each part is connected (thus the spectrum). At this point in the flyover the body section will
                    be highlighted and contextualized and the restof the color background will be faded out.
