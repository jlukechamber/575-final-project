                <p>
                    We begin our journey through the continents at the mental conception of the body.
                    Mahatma Gandhi, known for his philosophies of non-violence, viewed the physical
                    body as a representation of violence, and that the presence of the body prevented humans
                    from practicing perfect non-violence. Gandhi was concerned with the idea of absolute
                    violence, or the injuring or killing of another living being. The requirements to
                    maintain the human body (food, water, shelter being at the bottom of Maslow’s
                    hierarchy of needs) makes violence, in Gandhi’s eyes, unavoidable.
                    The body continent is divided into four regions the empirical, the anatomical, the experiential,
                    and the instinctual conceptions of the body.

                <h3><br><br><br>Conscious Mind</h3>
                <p>
                    The 17th century French philosopher Renes Descartes proposed in the famous line
                    “I think therefore I am”, establishing the conscious mind as an entity wholly distinct
                    from the body. Our mind’s ability to think about thinking is the foundation of
                    consciousness. Even if we doubt the existence of everything else, the mind is aware
                    of the existence of itself. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="../assets/descartes.jpg" alt="">
                    Jean Paul Sartre, in his 1943 text Being and Nothingness, built upon Descartes’ ideas. Consciousness
                    (or being) could be thought of as consisting of two types: being-in-itself (left region) and
                    being-for-itself
                    (right region). Being-in-itself concerns the being – or mere existence - of objects. In Sartre’s
                    mind,
                    this type of being was not the place of humans but rather objects. A person working as a waiter is
                    not
                    primarily a waiter (being-in-itself), rather a person is primarily a person (being-for-itself) who
                    just
                    happens to serve the function of a waiter.
                    <br><br>
                    Being for-itself refers to the idea of you as a person. Sartre said that to act in good faith, an
                    individual must be aware of their own consciousness through self-reflection. To not only be aware of
                    yourself,
                    but to be aware of your own self-reflection.

                <h3><br><br><br>Subjectivity</h3>
                <p>
                    How can two people have radically different experiences of the exact same thing?
                    Two people walking together as a rainstorm starts have wildly different reactions – one
                    depressed, while the other elated. Subjectivity is the idea that one objective reality
                    (a rainstorm) can produce multiple interpretations due to differences in perception,
                    mood, feelings, abilities, creativity, language etc. gathered from previous experience.
                    <br><br>
                    The subjectivity of the self has been conceptualized as “me as a person” and “I as myself”. In
                    Buddhism,
                    the self is thought of as only an illusion to be deconstructed. Paradoxically, the nature of the
                    self can
                    only be known through the “inquiring spirit” that doubts and negates self.
                    As Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard famously said; “subjectivity is truth.”

            <section id="ego">
                <h3><br><br><br>Ego</h3>
                <p>
                    The ego moderates the unrealistic id and the external world to govern how one ought to act in the
                    world.
                    The left region of the Ego continent is concerned with the ego “for itself”, or the selfish ego.
                    Sigmund Freud’s pleasure principle, the foundation of psychological egoism, suggests that all
                    behavior
                    is motivated by self-interest seeking to maximize pleasure and minimize displeasure. Behaving in
                    this way,
                    however, is untenable and must be balanced by the ego “within itself”, the altruistic ego. Debate
                    persists
                    to whether true altruism is possible if the performer of the act receives a reward in the form of
                    self-gratification for performing a good deed.

            <section id="antiego">
                <h3><br><br><br>Antiego</h3>
                <p>
                    The anti-ego is divided into four conceptual regions: the “ideal ego” (top left),
                    the “conscience” (bottom left), the individual soul (top right), and the eternal soul
                    (bottom right).
                    <br><br>
                    Atop Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is the ideal self, self-actualization,
                    or the “ideal ego.” Only when all other base needs (physiological, safety,
                    love & belongingness, and esteem) have been met, can one be free to pursue one’s unique
                    potential and fulfillment.
                    <br><br>
                    The conscience – Freud’s superego – is the inner voice that tells us when we’ve done
                    something wrong. It is the foil to the id and is learned from the outside world (parents)
                    at an early age.
                    The divine individual is the way in which western philosophy beginning in ancient Greece has
                    conceptualized
                    the soul. It is “something that a person can risk and lose and that, after death, endures as a shade
                    in the
                    underworld”. By contrast the eternal soul, arising from eastern philosophy, purports that the human
                    soul is a
                    part of the soul of God and that we are part of an interconnected collective soul.

                <p>
                    The opposite of the self is the other. If the self exists, then the other exists as well. 
                    The environment in which the self exists is the other that is in constant interaction with the self. 
                    Materialism is the idea that all things develop as a product of their environment, and that change occurs 
                    when contradictions exist in the conditions of the environment (e.g., organisms evolve when there is a 
                    contradiction between their adaptive characteristics and their environment). The interaction between the 
                    self and the other can be conceptualized as others in me (right) and me in others (left).

                <h3><br><br><br>Will</h3>
                <p>
                    19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in his work The World as Will and Representation 
                    coined the term wille zum leben (the will to life), a force within all of us more powerful than reason, 
                    logic, or emotion. This is a mindless, aimless impulse that serves as the bedrock for all our instincts 
                    and the foundation of all life. Schopenhauer posited this as the reason why much of our social lives are 
                    dictated by romance and love.
                    <br><br>
                    The continent is divided into three parts. The collective will exists through social conditioning, 
                    norms, etc. and sits below the anti-ego’s will (right) and the ego’s will (left). The anti-ego’s will 
                    is dictated by morality, and the ego’s by reality.

                <h3><br><br><br>Freedom</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two regions in the continent of Freedom: authoritative freedom (i.e., freedom of thought and feeling), 
                    and transformative freedom (i.e., freedom of action and creation). Kierkegaard considers a man standing 
                    on the edge of a tall building. The man looks over the edge and is overcome by two fears simultaneously – the fear 
                    of falling, and the fear of having a sudden impulse to jump. The second fear comes from the man realizing that 
                    he has the complete freedom to choose. Kierkegaard calls this the “dizziness of freedom,” and suggests that we 
                    experience it whenever we make a moral decision. Rather than becoming overcome by this anxiety, we can instead 
                    use it to enhance our self-determination and the sense of responsibility and ownership we feel over the decisions 
                    we make.

                <h3><br><br><br>Unconscious</h3>
                <p>
                    When a smell or an image unexpectedly conjures up an old memory you had thought was forgotten, 
                    your mind is delving into the unconscious - the place containing the memories and impulses of which 
                    in our day-to-day lives we are unaware. The collective unconscious is a concept introduced by psychiatrist 
                    Carl Jung, that represents a form of the unconscious that is common to all humankind regardless of culture. 
                    Evidence for the existence of the collective unconscious is observable in people from opposite sides of the world having dreams of imagery reminiscent of a shared mythology. This, Jung posits, suggests that these images come from a shared origin in the mind.
                    <br><br>
                    Sitting above the collective unconscious are the unconscious body (left) and unconscious mind (right). 
                    According to Freud, there exists a vast unconscious mind that exists below the conscious mental processes 
                    of which we are aware.

                <h3><br><br><br>Objectivity</h3>
                <p>
                    A debate as old as philosophy: nature (right) vs nurture (left). Does our environment make us what we are (nurture), or 
                    does our genetic blueprint define us (nature)? Nietzsche claims, somewhat paradoxically, that we are both fated to be 
                    as we are, and that we can create our own realization of ourselves. These seemingly contradictory notions can be simultaneously 
                    true. Our minds are formed by both the environment in which we are raised, and our genetic code.
