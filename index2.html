                <h3>The brain and mind are not the same...</h3>
                <p>
                    Like explorers venturing into uncharted seas, neuroscience has endeavored to map
                    the 10s of millions of connections in our brains. Some believe
                    that the key to unlocking the mysteries of the mind is in mapping these connections and great advancements in connectomics – the field of neuroscience that creates maps –
                    has produced neural maps of worms, flies, mice, and even parts of the human brain.
                    <br><br>

                    <img src="../assets/brain_map1.png" alt="" style="float: left">However,
                    philosophy has, throughout the course of human civilization, proposed that the mind is something
                    more than the connections in the brain. Something intangible. Something that perhaps cannot be
                    mapped in the same way. The thoughts, ideas, concepts, sensations, emotions, intuitions, and
                    imaginations that we conceive of as the mind exist somewhere in a space between. A space that
                    remains unquantifiable by even the most high-fidelity map of every neuron and every
                    connection in the human brain. Science, for all its’ ability to explain
                    complex phenomena, may be unable to explain the intricacies of our minds.

                    Explorers of a different kind venture inward into the vast oceans of our mind in search of the same elusive questions that have sparked curiosity for millennia.

                <h3>Unpacking the black box...</h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="../assets/black_box.png" alt="">
                    The contents of the mind have been referred to as a “black box” of the unknown.
                    First conceptualized by American psychologist and behavioralist B.F. Skinner,
                    the box describes that which traditional behavioralists believe to be unobservable.
                    Skinner believed that what we perceive of as free will is actually an illusion created
                    by repeated reinforcement of responses to stimulus. To behavioralists like Skinner,
                    the mind exists as a black box – we know how it functions and can alter the outputs
                    (response) by altering the inputs (stimulus). Others argue that this is not the entire story.
                    That consciousness is more nuanced, and that the black box can be opened. Free will is deeper
                    than stimulus and response, and that the perception of having free will is enough to confirm
                    its existence. Opening Skinner’s “black box” requires reviewing all the contents between stimulus
                    and response to reconstruct the oneness of the mind.
                </p>

                <p>We have mastered our understanding and organization of the external world through science,
                    however, we have yet to master to the same degree our understanding and
                    organization of the experience of the internal world through philosophy.</p>

                    We begin our journey through the continents at the mental conception of the body.
                    Mahatma Gandhi, known for his philosophies of non-violence, viewed the physical
                    body as a representation of violence, and that the presence of the body prevented humans
                    from practicing perfect non-violence. Gandhi was concerned with the idea of absolute
                    violence, or the injuring or killing of another living being. The requirements to
                    maintain the human body (food, water, shelter being the foundation of Maslow’s
                    hierarchy of needs) made violence, in Gandhi’s eyes, unavoidable.
                    The body continent is divided into four regions the<b><em> empirical</em></b>, the<b><em> anatomical</em></b>,
                    the <b><em>experiential</em></b>,
                    and the <b><em>instinctual</em></b> conceptions of the body.

                <div class="clearfix">

                    17th century French philosopher Renes Descartes proposed that
                    “I think therefore I am”, establishing the conscious mind as an entity wholly distinct
                    from the body. The mind’s ability to think about thinking is the foundation of
                    consciousness. Even if we doubt the existence of everything else, the mind is aware
                    of the existence of itself.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="../assets/waiter.png" alt="" style="float: left">
                    Jean Paul Sartre, in his 1943 text <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, built upon Descartes’ ideas.
                    Consciousness
                    (or being) can be thought of as consisting of two types: <b><em>being-in-itself</em></b> (left) and
                    <b><em>being-for-itself</em></b>
                    (right). <b><em>Being-in-itself</em></b> concerns the being – or existence - of objects. In Sartre’s
                    mind,
                    this type of being was not the place of humans but rather objects. A person working as a server is
                    not
                    primarily a server (<b><em>being-in-itself</em></b>), rather a person is primarily a person
                    (<b><em>being-for-itself</em></b>) who
                    just
                    happens to be performing the function of a server.
                    <br><br>
                    Another way to think of <b><em>being-for-itself</em></b> is the idea of you as a person. Sartre said that
                    to act in good faith, an
                    individual must be aware of their own consciousness through self-reflection. They must not only be aware of
                    themself,
                    but also aware of their own self-reflection.

                    <img src="../assets/rainstorm.png" alt="">
                    How can two people have radically different experiences of the same event?
                    Two people walking together as a rainstorm starts have wildly different reactions – one
                    depressed, while the other elated. Subjectivity is the idea that one objective reality
                    (a rainstorm) can produce multiple interpretations due to differences in perception,
                    mood, feelings, abilities, creativity, language etc. gathered from previous experience.
                    <br><br>

                    The subjectivity of the self can be conceptualized as <b><em>"me as a person"</em></b> and <b><em>"I as
                        myself"</em></b>.
                    In Buddhism,
                    the self is thought of as only an illusion to be deconstructed. Paradoxically, the nature of the
                    self can
                    only be known through the “inquiring spirit” that seeks to doubt and negate the self.
                    <br><br>
                    As Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard famously said; “subjectivity is truth.”

                    <img src="../assets/obelisk.png" alt="">
                    The ego moderates the unrealistic id and the external world to govern how one ought to act in the
                    world.
                    The left region of the Ego continent is concerned with the ego <b><em>for itself</em></b>, or the selfish
                    ego.
                    Sigmund Freud’s pleasure principle, the foundation of psychological egoism, suggests that all
                    behavior
                    is motivated by self-interest seeking to maximize pleasure and minimize displeasure. Behaving in
                    this way,
                    however, is untenable and must be balanced by the ego <b><em>within itself</em></b>, the altruistic ego.
                    Debate
                    persists
                    to whether true altruism is possible if the performer of the act receives a reward in the form of
                    self-gratification for performing a good deed.

                <div class="clearfix">
                    The anti-ego is divided into four regions: the <b><em>ideal ego</em></b> (top left),
                    the <b><em>conscience</em></b> (bottom left), the <b><em>individual soul</em></b> (top right), and the <b><em>eternal

                    <br><br>

                    Atop Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is the ideal self, self-actualization,
                    or the <b><em>ideal ego</em></b>. Only when all other base needs (physiological, safety,
                    love & belongingness, and esteem) have been met, can one be free to pursue one’s unique
                    potential and fulfillment.
                    <br><br><img src="../assets/collective_soul.png" alt="" style="float: left">
                    The <b><em>conscience</em></b> – Freud’s superego – is the inner voice that tells us when we’ve done
                    something wrong. It is the foil to the id and is learned from the outside world (parents)
                    at an early age.
                    The <b><em>divine individual</em></b> is the way in which some western philosophies beginning in ancient Greece
                    has
                    conceptualized
                    the soul. It is something that a person can risk and lose and that, after death, endures as a shade
                    in the
                    underworld. By contrast the <b><em>eternal soul</em></b> in many eastern philosophies purports that the human
                    soul is a
                    part of the soul of God and that we are part of an interconnected collective soul.

                    The environment in which the self exists is the other that is in constant interaction with the self.
                    Materialism is the idea that all things develop as a product of their environment, and that change
                    occurs
                    when contradictions exist in the conditions of the environment (e.g., organisms evolve when there is
                    a
                    contradiction between their adaptive characteristics and their environment). The interaction between
                    the
                    self and the other can be conceptualized as <b><em>others in me</em></b> (right) and <b><em>me in

                    19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in his work <em>The World as Will and

                    coined the term <em>wille zum leben</em> (the will to life), a force within all of us more powerful
                    than reason,
                    logic, or emotion. This is a mindless, aimless impulse that serves as the bedrock for all our
                    instincts
                    and the foundation of all life. Schopenhauer presents this as the driving force behind why much of
                    our social lives are
                    dictated to such an extent by romance and love.

                    <img src="../assets/surreal_building.png" alt="">
                    There are two regions in the Freedom continent: <b><em>authoritative freedom</em></b> (i.e., freedom of
                    thought and feeling),
                    and <b><em>transformative freedom</em></b> (i.e., freedom of action and creation). Kierkegaard considers a
                    man standing
                    on the edge of a tall building. The man looks over the edge and is overcome by two fears
                    simultaneously – the fear
                    of falling, and the fear of having a sudden impulse to jump. The second fear comes from the man
                    realizing that
                    he has the complete freedom to choose. Kierkegaard calls this the “dizziness of freedom,” and
                    suggests that we
                    experience it whenever we make a moral decision. Rather than becoming overcome by this anxiety, we
                    can instead

                    the decisions

                    When a smell or an image unexpectedly conjures up an old memory you had thought was long forgotten,
                    your mind is delving into the unconscious - the place containing the memories and impulses of which
                    in our day-to-day lives we are unaware. The <b><em>collective unconscious</em></b> is a concept introduced
                    by psychiatrist
                    Carl Jung that represents a form of the unconscious that is common to all humankind regardless of
                    culture.
                    Evidence for the existence of the collective unconscious is observable in people from opposite sides
                    of the world having dreams of imagery reminiscent of a shared mythology. This, Jung posits, suggests
                    that these images come from a shared origin in the mind.
                    <br><br>
                    Sitting above the <b><em>collective unconscious</em></b> are the <b><em>unconscious body</em></b> (left) and
                    <b><em>unconscious mind</em></b> (right).
                    According to Freud, there exists a vast unconscious mind below the conscious mental processes
                    of which we are aware.

                    A debate as old as philosophy: <b><em>nature</em></b> (right) vs <b><em>nurture</em></b> (left). Does our environment make us what
                    we are (<b><em>nurture</em></b>), or
                    does our genetic blueprint define us (<b><em>nature</em></b>)? Nietzsche claims, somewhat paradoxically, that we are
                    both fated to be
                    as we are, and that we can create our own realization of ourselves. These seemingly contradictory
                    notions can be simultaneously
                    true. Our minds are formed by both the environment in which we are raised, and our genetic code.

                <p>The idea of brain lateralization – or the notion that different mental processes
